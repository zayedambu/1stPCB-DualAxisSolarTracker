# 1stPCB-DualAxisSolarTracker
This repository documents my first steps into the exciting world of Printed Circuit Board (PCB) design using KiCad. Inspired by my previous Arduino-based dual-axis solar tracking system (which, let's be honest, was a glorious wire mess 😅), I decided to dedicate my college break to learning how to create professional-looking and functional circuits.
🚀 What's Inside?
This project captures my learning journey through the fundamental stages of PCB design:

Schematic Design: The logical representation of the circuit, detailing how components are connected.

Footprint Assignment: Mapping physical component dimensions to the schematic symbols.

PCB Layout & Routing: The art of placing components and drawing the copper traces that connect them on the board.

It's been a really interesting day, full of discoveries and problem-solving!

🛠️ Tools Used
KiCad: The open-source EDA suite used for designing the PCB.

💡 Rookie Mistakes & Open for Suggestions!
As this is my very first dive into KiCad and formal PCB design, I'm sure there are plenty of rookie mistakes, design rule violations, and unconventional choices lurking within these files!

I am completely open to all feedback and suggestions. My goal is to learn and improve, and there's no better way than to share and get insights from experienced folks. Please feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or just drop a comment with your thoughts!

Let's learn together!
